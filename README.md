# Ship-Detection
This repo have starter code for simulation of detection of ships using aircrafts

Number of aircrafts are multiple for detecting single ship.
Travelling route for aircrafts assumed to fixed.
Ships and aircrafts travels in straight lines.
Finally outputs overall detection probability of the ship.
